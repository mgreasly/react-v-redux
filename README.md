# react-v-redux

Working through redux and redux-toolkit. So, the classic todos app. What's in the branches?

## master
Implemented with state - held in App and passed to the child components.

## redux
Implemented with Redux. Using ...connect syntax.

## redux-hooks
Taken implementation from bas react and used hooks instead.

## redux-toolkit
Implemented with Redux-Toolkit.

## redux-hooks-toolkit
Merged the hooks and toolkit implementations (so, probably the final state).

## Note: 
Created from [nano-react-app](https://github.com/adrianmcli/nano-react-app).
